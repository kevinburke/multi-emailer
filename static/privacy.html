<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We need your permission to send an email. The fact that you sent an email, and
the recipients of that email, may be written to disk. The contents and subject
line of an email are never logged.</p>
<p>The only emails we'll ever send on your behalf are ones where you type in the
interface, choose a recipient and click &quot;Send.&quot; We'll never sell your email
address or send emails without your permission.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't store the information that would allow us to send emails
without your permission. It's stored in a cookie in your browser. If you delete
cookies, you remove our ability to send emails on your behalf. You can also

<p>All emails we send on your behalf should appear in your &quot;Sent&quot; folder in your
GMail account after a minute or so. (If they don't, check whether you have an
automated rule that moves or deletes emails.)</p>
<p>There are no third-party analytics scripts running on the page. Your draft
emails are never read by anyone, or logged.</p>
